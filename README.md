##Angular Single Page Application - thomasgreco.me

**Technologies In this Project**
	* absolute naming with [ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/) to create nested views for each page.
	* The Compass framework to create 12 column grid with the Susy Grid System.
	* Utilized jQuery in correlation with [TinyNav.js](https://github.com/viljamis/TinyNav.js) to appened the `#nav` ID selector to create a dropdown menu on viewports smaller than 768px.  
	* Defined a schema for my contact form on the server using Mongoose with MongoDB. I then referred to this schema in angular to ensure PUT requests are issued when a form is submitted.

###Next Steps:
* Create an admin dashboard for users, to sign-in, and create a content management systems for creating posts, and other future resources.

###Technologies I am thinking of using... 
* [Firebase](https://firebase.com) & a solution similar to [FirePad](https://firepad.io) 
* [Blogger](https://developers.google.com/blogger/docs/1.0/developers_guide_js)
* [Swagger.io](http://swagger.io/)
